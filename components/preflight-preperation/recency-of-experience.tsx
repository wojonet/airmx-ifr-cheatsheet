        <p>The following are requirements to consider before undertaking a VFR or IFR flight.</p>
        <h3>Current Flight Reveiw</h3>
        <p>
          A flight review is required every 24 calendar months. The flight review must consist of at least 1 hour of
          ground training and 1 hour of flight training.
        </p>
        <p>
          A flight review is <strong>not</strong> required if one of the following applies:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The pilot has completed a pilot proficiency check or passed a practical test for an additional certificate,
            rating or operating privilege (by an appoved check airman or designated examiner).
          </li>
          <li>The pilot has completed a phase of the FAA&apos;s WINGS program.</li>
        </ul>
        <Alert color="yellow" icon={<IconAlertCircle size={16} />} className="my-4">
          A flight review may be completed in a simulator given is part of an approved Part 142 training program and the
          simulator reperesents the aircraft for which the pilot is rated.

          <strong>Day: </strong>In order to carry passengers on a day flight, a pilot must have completed 3 takeoffs and
          landings within the previous 90 days. If the aircraft is a tailwheel aircraft, the pilot must have completed
          each landing to a full stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Night: </strong>In order to carry passengers on a night flight, a pilot must have completed 3 takeoffs
          and landings (to a full stop) within the previous 90 days. These takeoffs and landings must take place between
          1 hour after sunset and 1 hour before sunrise.

          <h4>In the past 6 months</h4>
          In order to conduct a flight under IFR, a pilot must have completed and logged the following within the
          previous <strong>6 calendar months</strong> in actual or simulated IFR conditions.
          <ul>
            <li>Six instrument approaches</li>
            <li>Holding procedures</li>
            <li>Intercepting and tracking courses using a navigational system</li>
          </ul>

            <p>
              These requirements may be completed in an approved full flight simulator, flight training device, or
              aviation training device provided the device represents the category of aircraft the pilot will use.
            </p>
            <p>You must log information on the training device, time spent and content.</p>

          <h4>6 month grace period</h4>
          <p>
            <p>
              If the pilot has not completed the above requirements within the previous 6 months, has an additional 6
              months to complete the above requirements to be instrument current, however, the pilot must perform the
              tasks under simulated instrument conditions with a safety pilot (or flight instructor) in the aircraft.
            </p>
            <p>
              The safety pilot must hold at least a private pilot certificate rated for the category and class of
